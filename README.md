# 1410Scouting
The Official 1410 Scouting App

 This is a custom website that is being designed for FRC and FTC match scouting, mainly to collect and process data from devices and send it to a server for data analysis.
This website is advantageous and more customizable than the previous method of collecting data, which was a Google Form. It was designed primarily for ease of use.

This would mostly be used at competitions, but can theoretically be used anytime. 
FRC Team 1410 is developing this app, but this app will likely be used by a few FTC teams.

The website can be accessed at https://1410Scouting.xyz, but it has no real functionality at the moment without access to the server.

Server backend avalible at https://github.com/RowanEklund/1410ScoutingServer.

More detailed README coming soon!
